At vende det blinde øje til trusler er uansvarligt; vi har en pligt til at beskytte hinanden. Derfor støtter jeg stærkt, at politiet får lov til at bruge ansigtsgenkendelse i det offentlige rum. Jeg er ærligt talt træt af at føle mig utryg, når jeg færdes alene, da kriminaliteten i mit område har gjort mig konstant ængstelig. Jeg ønsker, at politiet bruger denne teknologi, så jeg ikke behøver at bekymre mig hver gang, jeg går ned ad gaden."

At støtte denne politik er det rigtige at gøre, og jeg er fuldt ud for det. Derudover er jeg virkelig glad for idéen om en transportydelse, fordi det ville lette presset på mit månedlige budget betydeligt. At have den ekstra støtte ville gøre min daglige pendling meget mindre stressende."

Desuden giver det at gøre sundhedsydelser offentlige en følelse af tryghed til dem, der i øjeblikket kæmper for at få den nødvendige pleje."
